# Sickle-Cell-Disease

A basic python program that imitates the effects of Sickle Cell Disease on DNA before grouping the DNA structures
to corresponding amino acids.

In bioinformatics, sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA
or protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional,
structural or evolutionary relationships between the sequence.

This program simulates the effects of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism that leads to sickle cell disease.

Please note this is more an exercise is showcasing some core Python programming skills than it is an exercise in bioinformatics.
The project deals with some basic data structures, conditional statements, loops as well as readind and writing to and from external documents.
